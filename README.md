## Part 3

Careful planning of the structure of the HTML can assist with identifying selectors in both CSS and Javascript. How do you think the structure of the ttt files so far do or do not help with that goal?

Answer:

I think the current structure of the divs is workable, but personally would have liked another level of containers to add the idea of a row or a column. I think this would made it easier to style things versus relying on the child number or the ids to create a collection of elements. I do think having the IDs match to the indices of the squares in the gameboard is helpful for identifying where to put X's and O's which will ultimately be helpful when identifying whether a user has won.
